Then I just did a 4 year TDS test on Eurusd with a recommended set, then it blew the 3k account in 1 year. Guess I was wrong about this, so removing it from my account, and its grid system anyway, no worries. The news filter could have changed the backtest results, but its strategy is dumb, I'm not using it anymore.\r\n\r\nI did more testing with safer sets and managed to get a stable profit without blowing the account, might consider adding this to my account when it reaches 100k because then it would be a high-reward and low-risk portfolio expert advisor.
